*A custom task for Apache Ant which acts as an interface to the XML Directory Listing program.*

Define the task in your build file:

{{{
<taskdef name="jsmin"
        classname="net.matthaynes.jsmin.JSMin_Task"
        classpath="/path/to/jsmin.jar"/>
}}}

Using the task on a single file, with the _.min_ suffix added to the file extension:

{{{ 
<jsmin srcfile="file.js" suffix="true" />

Using the task with a fileset, and an output directory specified:

       <fileset dir="./somejsdirectory/" includes="**/*.js"/>
</jsmin>
}}}

==Support==

If you have any issues then please let us know, I will see what I can do.  I would also be very interested to hear what platforms and Ant versions people are using as I have not had time to extensivley test this task.
